# 📊Titanic-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Python-Libraries


This project i learned from my m.tech class 
performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 🔧 Key Steps

- Imported essential Python libraries.
- Loaded the Titanic dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.
- Displayed the first and last 10 rows of the dataset.
- Visualized missing values using a heatmap.
- Explored relationships and distributions using various plots:
  - Scatter Plot
  - Bar Chart
  - Pie Chart
  - Histogram
  - Box Plot
  - Line Plot
  - Strip Plot
  - Violin Plot
  - Pair Plot
- Analyzed correlations between numeric columns.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `seaborn`

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Titanic Dataset**, commonly used for machine learning and data analysis practice. It includes passenger information like:
- Age
- Fare
- Sex
- Embarked (port)
- Survival status

---

## 📌 Objective

To understand the data and derive visual insights into survival patterns, missing values, and relationship
